## Files

- `face_detection.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook explaining the step-by-step process of using Haar Cascade for face detection. The notebook provides code examples and explanations.
- `images/`: A folder containing images used in the notebook for demonstration purposes.
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: The pre-trained Haar Cascade XML file for face detection.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Elhassnaoui2001/Face-Detection.git`
2. Open the `face_detection.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the notebook cells to understand the process and see the face detection in action.
4. Modify the notebook as needed and use your own images to experiment with the face detection technique.

## Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Pillow (`pip install pillow`)

## Usage

1. Open the `face_detection.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Follow along with the explanations and code examples in the notebook.
3. Experiment with different images or adjust parameters to see how the Haar Cascade detects faces.
